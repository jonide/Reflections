When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I could be using multiple local machines, or I could be collaborating with others, and I could want to use the remote repository as a safer backup.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If I'm collaborating with others, for example, I may not be ready yet for their changes.
