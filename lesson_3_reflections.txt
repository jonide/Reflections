When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I could be using multiple local machines, or I could be collaborating with others, and I could want to use the remote repository as a safer backup.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If I'm collaborating with others, for example, I may not be ready yet for their changes. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Branches occur in a single repository, clones copy a repository locally or between Github and locally, and forks copy a repository within Github. Forks also do things like linking back to their origin.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

It lets me see if I've made changes that need to be pushed to the remote, and I can see that even if I'm offline.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

There would have to be a lot of emailing of files back and forth, something like that. History would have to be maintained manually.
