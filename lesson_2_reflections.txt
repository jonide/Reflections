How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area flags which files in the working directory will be added to the repository. It gives the user control over which files go together in a commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Only add files to the staging area that pertain to the logical change. If needed, use git rm to remove from the staging area, but with the --cached option so the file won't be deleted from the working directory.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

If I have experimental changes that I want to try or if I have multiple alternative versions of a project.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

They make it possible to see the structure as a tree.
